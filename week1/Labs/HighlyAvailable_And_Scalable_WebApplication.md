# HighlyAvailable_And_Scalable_WebApplication:

If you don't have a root AWS account yet, click  to learn how to create a new AWS account.

Create an IAM user
If you already have an AWS account or create an AWS account, create an IAM user that has access to AWS account. Log in to the AWS account, you can create a IAM user using IAM console. Create an IAM user with Administrator role. If you already have an IAM user with administrator role, continue.

I will walk you throught the steps for AWS General Immersion Day - Advanced hands-on lab introducing AWS core services(VPC, EC2, RDS, S3) enable you to build your own web application same as the architecture below.

### Hands on Lab Configuration: 

Specifically, we will walk you through the following topics.

1. Network – Amazon VPC
2. Compute – Amazon EC2
3. Database – Amazon Aurora
4. Storage – Amazon S3
5. Clean up resource


### Step1: Network – Amazon VPC:

Fianl Architecture:

* After logging in to the AWS console, select VPC from the service menu.
* Select VPC Dashboard and click Launch VPC Wizard to create your own VPC.
* To create a space to provision AWS resources used in this lab, we will create a VPC and Subnets. Select VPC, subnets, etc in Resource to create tab and change name tag to VPC-Lab. Leave the default setting for IPv4 CIDR block.
* To design high availability architecture, we create 2 subnet space and select 2a and 2c for Customize AZs. And set the CIDR value of the public subnet that can communicate directly with the Internet as shown in the screen below. Set the CIDR value of the private subnet as:
* 
    KEY	                            VALUE
2a Public subnet’s IPv4 CIDR	  10.0.10.0/24
2c Public subnet’s IPv4 CIDR	  10.0.20.0/24
2a Private subnet’s IPv4 CIDR	  10.0.100.0/24
2c Private subnet’s IPv4 CIDR  	10.0.200.0/24
