## Observability:

<b>Observability</b> in AWS refers to the ability to understand and analyze what's happening within your systems by collecting and analyzing data from various sources. It involves gathering information on metrics, logs, traces, and other data points to provide insights into the performance, health, and behavior of your applications and infrastructure running on AWS services.

AWS offers various tools and services to enhance observability, such as:

### Amazon CloudWatch:
Monitors and collects metrics, logs, and events from AWS services and resources, allowing you to set alarms, visualize data, and take automated actions based on predefined thresholds.

### AWS X-Ray:
Provides distributed tracing to analyze and debug production applications, allowing you to understand how services interact with each other and identify performance bottlenecks.

### AWS CloudTrail: 
Records API calls made on your AWS account, providing audit logs for security analysis, resource tracking, and compliance auditing.

### Amazon Inspector: 
Assesses the security and compliance of applications by analyzing the behavior of AWS resources and identifying potential security issues.



By using these tools and integrating them into your AWS environment, you can gain deeper insights into your infrastructure, troubleshoot issues more effectively, and ensure the overall health and performance of your applications.
