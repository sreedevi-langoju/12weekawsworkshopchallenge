## High volume email automation using SES and CodeWhisperer:

Mass Emailing with Amazon Web Services- AWS Lambda, SES, CloudWatch, IAMRoles and CodeWhisperer

The world of communication has evolved significantly in recent times, and businesses, organizations, and individuals often find themselves needing to send a large number of emails. However, manually managing this task can be tedious, time-consuming, and prone to errors. This is where Amazon Web Services (AWS) comes to the rescue, offering a seamless solution to automate mass emailing. In this blog, we will explore how to leverage AWS services, including AWS Lambda, CloudWatch, IAM Roles, and Simple Email Service (SES),and CodeWhisperer to create a robust and efficient mass emailing system with code companion.

#### Step 1: Creating an IAM Role

To kickstart our journey into mass emailing automation with AWS, the first step is setting up an Identity and Access Management (IAM) role. This role ensures secure access to AWS resources while executing your mass emailing tasks.<br>

* Open the AWS console, and in the search bar, type 'IAM' and select the IAM service.<br>
* In the IAM dashboard, navigate to 'Roles' and click on 'Create role.'<br>
* Select the use case as 'Lambda' and proceed to the next step.<br>
* In the 'Permissions' section, choose 'CloudWatch full access','AWSLambdaExecute' and 'SES full access' policies to grant the role the necessary permissions.<br>
* Provide a meaningful name for the role and click 'Create role.'<br>

#### Step 2: Verify email addresses or domain to send emails through Amazon SES <br>

You need to verify your email addresses or domain to send emails through Amazon SES.<br>

To verify your identity and send emails through Amazon Simple Email Service (SES), follow these steps:<br>
* Going to the Amazon SES console.<br>
* Going to Verified identities > create identity> select an individual email address.<br>

* Enter your email address to verify and then click on Create identity.<br>

* Amazon SES will send a confirmation email to the address you entered. Open your email client, find the email from AWS Notifications, and click on the link to confirm the email address. This link will take you to a confirmation page on the AWS website.<br>
* Once you've clicked the confirmation link, you'll receive a confirmation success message, and the email address will be marked as verified in the SES console.
You can now use the verified email address or domain to send emails through Amazon SES. <br>

<br>

* If you want to verify an entire domain (e.g., yourcompany.com) instead of individual email addresses, you can do this from the SES console. Navigate to "Domains" and follow the steps to verify the domain. This involves adding DNS records to your domain's DNS settings.<br>

* Before sending production emails, consider sending a test email to verify that your setup works as expected. Use the "Send a Test Email" option in the SES console.<br>

Remember that SES has both a sandbox and a production environment. In the sandbox, you can only send emails to verified email addresses or domains. To move to the production environment and send emails to any recipient, you must submit a request to Amazon SES for production access. Once approved, you can send emails to anyone, but you'll be responsible for following anti-spam regulations and best practices.<br>

#### Step 3: Creating a Lambda Function

AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that allows you to execute code without the hassle of managing servers. This makes it an excellent choice for automating email sending.<br>

* In the AWS console, search for 'Lambda' and select the Lambda service.<br>
* Choose Author from scratch option and provide a name for your Lambda function.<br>
* Choose the desired runtime for your function; for instance, Python 3.11.<br>
* Select the existing role you created in the previous step.<br>
* You can leave the rest of the settings as optional.<br>
* Click 'Create function.'<br>

Now that you have your Lambda function in place, you'll need to write code to send emails using it. 

You can also configure a test event for this function to ensure it works as expected.<br>

#### Step 4: Creating CloudWatch Events

AWS CloudWatch is a monitoring service that provides valuable insights into your AWS resources and allows you to schedule tasks, making it an ideal choice for automating email dispatch at specific times.<br>
In the Lambda console, select the Lambda function to which you want to add a CloudWatch Event Rule.<br>

* On the Lambda function configuration page,  click the "Add trigger" button.<br>
* In the "Add triggers" section, choose "CloudWatch Events" as the trigger source.<br>
* In the "Configure triggers" section, select "Create a new rule."<br>
* Provide a Rule name and description.<br>
* Choose the Rule type as "scheduled expression."<br>
* In the Schedule expression field, specify the cron or rate expression, e.g., rate(1 minute) for a 1-minute interval.<br>

* Click the "Add" button to add the CloudWatch Event Rule as a trigger for your Lambda function.<br>
* After adding the rule, you'll see it listed as a trigger in the Lambda function's configuration page.<br>
* Click "Save" to save the changes to your Lambda function.<br>

Your Lambda function is now associated with the CloudWatch Event Rule as a trigger, and it will be invoked based on the schedule you defined in the rule. Test and monitor your Lambda function to ensure it works as expected when triggered by the CloudWatch Event Rule.<br>

#### Conclusion

As a result of these steps, your Lambda function will be triggered, and it will send out emails at the scheduled times, making mass emailing a breeze.<br>
In conclusion, by integrating AWS Lambda, IAM roles, CloudWatch, and SES, you can establish an efficient and reliable solution for sending mass emails.
