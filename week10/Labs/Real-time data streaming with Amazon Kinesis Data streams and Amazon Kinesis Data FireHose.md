# Real-time data streaming with Amazon Kinesis Data streams and Amazon Kinesis Data FireHose

This blog guides you through the process of deploying a sample website on an EC2 Linux instance, utilizing the Apache web server, and capturing real-time website logs. These logs are then streamed to AWS S3 for storage and analysis using a combination of Kinesis Data Streams, Kinesis Agent, Kinesis Firehose, and S3.

By following this, you will have the opportunity to practice working with these AWS services and create a comprehensive data pipeline for processing website logs.
