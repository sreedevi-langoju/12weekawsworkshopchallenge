AWS Storage Gateway is a hybrid cloud storage solution that helps organizations seamlessly integrate on-premises environments with the AWS Cloud. It offers four types of gateways:

Amazon S3 File Gateway: Enables file data to be stored as objects in Amazon S3, suitable for data lakes, backups, and machine learning workflows.

Amazon FSx File Gateway: Provides low-latency access to fully managed file shares for various file-based applications.

Tape Gateway: Creates a virtual tape library stored in Amazon S3, ideal for backup applications and archival storage.

Volume Gateway: Offers block storage volumes over iSCSI, backed by Amazon S3, with support for point-in-time backups.

Common use cases for AWS Storage Gateway include moving backups to the cloud, presenting on-premises file shares backed by cloud storage, and providing low-latency access to cloud-stored data for on-premises applications. It simplifies storage management, reduces costs, and enhances data accessibility in a hybrid cloud environment.
