## Serverless:

Serverless architecture is a framework that allows you to build and run applications without managing the underlying infrastructure. Instead of provisioning and managing servers, you focus on writing code, and the cloud provider handles the rest, scaling automatically based on demand.


### 1. Why We Need Serverless Architecture:
Cost-effectiveness: Pay only for the resources used.
Scalability: Automatically scale based on demand.
Reduced operational burden: No need for server maintenance or provisioning.
Faster time-to-market: Focus on code development rather than infrastructure setup.

### 2. AWS Services in Serverless Architecture:

#### AWS Lambda:

AWS Lambda allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers.
Supports multiple programming languages and triggers (e.g., HTTP requests, database events).

#### AWS Step Functions:
Provides orchestration for serverless workflows.
Allows you to coordinate multiple AWS services into a serverless workflow.

#### Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service):
Facilitates message delivery between applications.
Enables the publishing of messages to various endpoints (e.g., Lambda functions, HTTP/S, email, etc.).

#### Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service):
Object storage service used for storing and retrieving data.
Highly scalable and secure storage option for various data types.

#### Amazon DynamoDB:
A fully managed NoSQL database service.
Offers high performance at any scale with automatic scaling and built-in security.
