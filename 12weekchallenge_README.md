# 12weekawsworkshopchallenge-

This 12-week workshop challenge is created to help cloud enthusiasts gain deep hands-on expertise on AWS. It's a collection of self-paced workshops developed by experts at AWS and is curated to help us gain expertise in AWS gradually. These workshops range from beginner-level to advanced, and the best part is that we can follow them at our own pace, whenever it suits us.Check this link for more details: https://12weeksworkshops.com/


In this blog series, I will take you on my journey through this challenge, sharing my experiences, insights, and the theoretical concepts I learned along the way.Â

### Week 1: AWS Core Services Overview

Hello AWS enthusiasts!  Week 1 of the 12 Weeks AWS Workshop Challenge was an exciting start, focusing on AWS Core Services Overview. I dedicated time to hands-on labs covering both basic and advanced modules, exploring fundamental AWS services.

#### Tasks Accomplished:

* Established a VPC with Public and Private Subnets across two Availability Zones.
* Set up a NAT Gateway and routing for network traffic.
* Deployed highly available web service instances using Auto Scaling Groups in private subnets.
* Implemented and tested RDS Aurora for a simple address book.
* Explored data manipulation techniques using Amazon S3, covering storage operations and static web page hosting.
* Documentation: Detailed information and steps are available in my Week 1 GitHub repository.

Excited to kick off this journey!


### Week 2: Identity and Access Management (IAM)

Week 2 of the 12 Weeks AWS Workshop Challenge delved into the crucial world of Identity and Access Management (IAM). Security took center stage as I managed IAM entities for robust security and permissions management.

#### Tasks Accomplished:

* Explored IAM for secure entity management.
* Delved into IAM for robust security measures.
* Updated permissions for secure access controls.
* Documentation: Find detailed insights and steps in my Week 2 GitHub repository.

Security is paramount, and IAM plays a key role! 

### Week 3: AWS Networking - VPC Peering

Week 3 was all about diving deep into AWS Networking, and I explored the fascinating world of Amazon VPC Peering. This powerful networking feature allows connecting two Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) for seamless traffic routing using private IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.

#### Tasks Accomplished:

* Successfully established VPC peering connections between VPC A and VPC B, and VPC A and VPC C.
* Ensured non-overlapping IP addresses in connected VPCs.
* Highlighted the non-transitive nature of VPC peering, ensuring VPC B won't have direct access to VPC C.
* Documentation: Step-by-step guide available on my GitHub repository. Dive in and explore the networking magic!

### Week 4: Storage with AWS Storage Gateway

Week 4 was all about storage, and I delved into the AWS Storage Gateway. This hybrid cloud storage solution bridges the gap between on-premises environments and the cloud, providing virtually limitless cloud storage with low-latency access to frequently used data.

#### Tasks Accomplished:

* Configured a File Gateway with an NFS file share, attached it to a Linux instance.
* Migrated a set of data from the Linux instance to an S3 bucket.
* Set up primary and secondary S3 buckets for data storage and Cross-Region Replication.
* Documentation: Detailed instructions are on my GitHub repository. Check it out for a storage journey!

### Week 5: AWS Databases - RDS and DMS

Hey Cloud Explorers! ðŸš€ Week 5 took me on a journey into the world of databases. Explored vital services like Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) and Database Migration with Amazon DMS (Database Migration Service).

#### Tasks Accomplished:

* Set up Mariadb on EC2 (Linux) as the source database, configured it, and inserted dummy data.
* Launched Amazon RDS MySQL as the target database.
* Configured Amazon DMS for the migration, smoothly replicating Mariadb to AWS RDS MySQL.
* Documentation: Step-by-step guide available on my GitHub repository. Dive into the database realm! 


### Week 6: Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Week 6 was all about Infrastructure as Code (IaC), focusing on AWS CloudFormation. This powerful tool automates resource creation and management through templates, providing consistency and efficiency.

#### Tasks Accomplished:

* Created an S3 bucket and uploaded YAML template files.
* Established a VPC with public and private subnets.
* Launched an EC2 instance with an Apache web server.
* Set up security groups for SSH and HTTP access.
* Documentation: Detailed instructions available on my GitHub repository.


### Week 7: Containers with Docker and ECS

Week 7 brought me into the world of containers, learning about Docker containers, image creation, and deployment on AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS).

#### Tasks Accomplished:

* Created a Docker image with Apache server and configurations.
* Pushed the Docker image to Amazon ECR for streamlined access.
* Set up an ECS cluster and defined a Task Definition.
* Validated the deployed Apache server's functionality.
* Documentation: Step-by-step guide on my GitHub repository.
