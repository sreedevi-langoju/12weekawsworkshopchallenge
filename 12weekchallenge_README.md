### Week 1: AWS Core Services Overview

Hello AWS enthusiasts!  Week 1 of the 12 Weeks AWS Workshop Challenge was an exciting start, focusing on AWS Core Services Overview. I dedicated time to hands-on labs covering both basic and advanced modules, exploring fundamental AWS services.

#### Tasks Accomplished:

* Established a VPC with Public and Private Subnets across two Availability Zones.
* Set up a NAT Gateway and routing for network traffic.
* Deployed highly available web service instances using Auto Scaling Groups in private subnets.
* Implemented and tested RDS Aurora for a simple address book.
* Explored data manipulation techniques using Amazon S3, covering storage operations and static web page hosting.
* Documentation: Detailed information and steps are available in my Week 1 GitHub repository.

Excited to kick off this journey!


### Week 2: Identity and Access Management (IAM)

Week 2 of the 12 Weeks AWS Workshop Challenge delved into the crucial world of Identity and Access Management (IAM). Security took center stage as I managed IAM entities for robust security and permissions management.

#### Tasks Accomplished:

* Explored IAM for secure entity management.
* Delved into IAM for robust security measures.
* Updated permissions for secure access controls.
* Documentation: Find detailed insights and steps in my Week 2 GitHub repository.

Security is paramount, and IAM plays a key role! 

### Week 3: AWS Networking - VPC Peering

Hey AWS enthusiasts! üåê Week 3 was all about diving deep into AWS Networking, and I explored the fascinating world of Amazon VPC Peering. This powerful networking feature allows connecting two Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) for seamless traffic routing using private IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.

#### Tasks Accomplished:

* Successfully established VPC peering connections between VPC A and VPC B, and VPC A and VPC C.
* Ensured non-overlapping IP addresses in connected VPCs.
* Highlighted the non-transitive nature of VPC peering, ensuring VPC B won't have direct access to VPC C.
* Documentation: Step-by-step guide available on my GitHub repository. Dive in and explore the networking magic!
